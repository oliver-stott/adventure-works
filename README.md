## Overview
This project was created as part of the [Maven Analytics - Microsoft Power BI for Business Intelligence](https://www.mavenanalytics.io/course/microsoft-power-bi-for-business-intelligence) course.

The goal of this project was to practice key BI skills including:
- Data modelling
- DAX calculations
- Designing impactful dashboards
- Extracting actionable business insights
- ETL/ELT Concepts
